# nerdpanel

A static site for examining your toots. A nerdy lil vanity~

The app provides full-text search for toots, supports using multiple accounts, and allows sorting toots by interactions.

## Usage

You can use the nerdpanel app on [garbados.github.io](https://garbados.github.io/nerdpanel) or you can build it yourself and use it locally, or deploy it wherever on the web.

## Install

Use [git](https://git-scm.com) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) to install the panel and build it.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:garbados/nerdpanel.git
cd nerdpanel
npm install
npm start
```

Running `npm start` will build the website to the `public/` folder.

You can also run `npm run serve` which will serve the app at `http://localhost:8000`.
